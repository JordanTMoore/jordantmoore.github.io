In this update we explore the possibilities of analytics with IBM TRIRIGA
Assistant. With Version 1.0.4 we are introducing a new dashboard for TRIRIGA
Administrators to help understand how the Assistant is being consumed by end users.

This new reporting dashboard helps visualize usage statistics like daily concurrent users, or satisfaction scores over the course of a month. We hope to expand this to even more exciting metrics in updates to come.
